**Overview:**  
This project presents a robust Diabetes Prediction Model that utilizes a RandomForestClassifier and advanced metaheuristic optimization algorithms for hyperparameter tuning. The model aims to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a set of key medical parameters, offering a valuable tool for early detection and risk assessment.
The core idea is to improve the RandomForestClassifier's performance by intelligently searching for the optimal combination of its hyperparameters. This is achieved through the implementation and comparison of several state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms: Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO).

**Features:**  
Accurate Diabetes Prediction: Leverages the power of RandomForestClassifier for classification.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explores and compares the effectiveness of four different metaheuristic algorithms (MPA, SSA, PSO, GWO) for optimizing model performance.
Python-based: Built entirely in Python, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers.
Input Parameters: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age.
